# My Data Analytics Project

This project is my work for the Module Principles of Data Analytics of the Course Data Analytics in [ATU Galway Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/).

This README follows the the instructions from [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in how to write README files.
 
## About this project

This repository is based on the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/), and I will put into practice the contents learned during this module to analyse the data.

## Purpose of this project

This project is very important so I can develop my skills as a data analyst, becoming more familiar in how to deal with information given in data sets.

## How to run this project

To analyse this data, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) need to be installed to run and visualise the data in any machine.
Also, this project can be open in Google Colab in the following link: <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/FatimaBOliveira/My-Data-Analytics-Project/blob/main/penguins.ipynb">
