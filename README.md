# My Data Analytics Project

This project is my work for the Module Principles of Data Analytics of the Course Data Analytics in [ATU Galway Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/).

## About this project

This project is based on the [Palmer Penguins Data Set](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/), and I will put into practice the content learned during this module to analyse this dataset.

## Purpose of this project

This project is very important so I can develop my skills as a data analyst, becoming more familiar in how to deal with information given in datasets.

## How to run this project

To analyse this data, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) need to be installed to run and visualise the data in any machine.
Also, this project can be open in Google colab in the following link: <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/FatimaBOliveira/My-Data-Analytics-Project/blob/main/penguins.ipynb">
